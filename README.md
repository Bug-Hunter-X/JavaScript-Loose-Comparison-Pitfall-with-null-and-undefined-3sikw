This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose comparisons (==) when dealing with null and undefined values.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous behavior, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).  This simple example highlights the importance of understanding the difference between loose and strict equality in JavaScript to prevent unexpected results and improve code reliability.
